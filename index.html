    <p>On the <a href="">LeGoBLADE</a> channel, I make lego related videos like "Things that are just wrong in lego" or lego set reviews. This channel is ment to amuse and be helpful for example, if you want to buy a lego set
    but you are not shure witch one to buy some of the videos on this channel may be helpful in that aspect. If you like the channel and some of the videos, please subscribe and leave a like, that
    would be realy realy helpfull because we are curently trying to build a house and move, but the builders are giving us a lot of issues with the house and the money so it would realy help, but in all
    seriousnes, like and subscribe even though you probably don't like the channel. Stay tuned for the video about the move. </p>
